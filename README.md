# Hi, and thanks for checking out my GitHub profile.

My name is Rien, and I'm a student in the geospatial world üó∫. I study [Geography and Geomatics at the University of Ghent, Belgium](https://geografie.ugent.be). 
And I'm mostly interested in Open Source geospatial solutions and getting down to low level stuff to understand it all better.

# Skills

 - GIS software like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) or [ESRI](https://www.esri.com) products, although I prefer QGIS
 - GIS cli tools like [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) (oh sweet mother of all that is open source geospatial)
 - Other shell tools and the shell itself on Linux and Unix like systems
 - Programming languages:
    - üêç Python
    - üêò SQL (Postgres, PostGIS, SQLite)
    - üï∏ HTML/CSS/JS
    - ‚òï Java (even though it's been a while since I've used it)
    - ü¶Ä Rust (still a beginnner)
    - ‚ûï C/C++ (still a beginner but no absolute beginner)

# Showcase

I might have to dissapoint you here since I have not much to showcase yet, still working on it.
Although I am proud of my [DHM Vlaanderen Downloader](https://github.com/SirRhynus/dhm_downloader_vlaanderen) QGIS plugin. 
It's a handy little tool to easily get the DEM of Flanders for a selected region.
I'm also working on a blog series where I explain my progress of hacking the GeoPackage file format to better understand how rasters are stored in it.
So keep an eye out for that.

I know there's not much here yet, but it's still a beginning. I'm still trying to create stuff to showcase my skills when I find the time.

You may also reach out to me on Twitter if that's your forte: [@SRhynus](https://twitter.com/SRhynus).  

Oh, and if you're on Discord, I've heard there's an amazing [GIS community](https://disboard.org/server/769917190182404127) on there. 
I've also heard there's a very talented moderator on there, named \**checks scribbled notes*\*... Sir Rhynus...
